## Usage

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python scrape.py
```

Please note that scrape.py may take a minute or two to finish.

The `urls` file has URLs that respond with a 502 and since the scraper retries scraping after a minute in case a url responds with a 502, the script may take a minute or two to finish.

## Todos

- Add tests!
